## Define a Web component

Osagai comes with a function called `define` that defines a new custom element that you can use in your application.
`define` receives the name of the custom element (it must contain a hyphen) and the Osagai component.
The Osagai component is a function that returns a Template with a string representing the layout of the web component.

```javascript
import { define } from 'osagai'

function MyComponent() {
	return () => `<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹!</h1>`
}

define('waving-hand', MyComponent)

```

Now, you just need to use your new custom element in your application.

```xml
<waving-hand></waving-hand>
```
