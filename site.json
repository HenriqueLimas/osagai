This will check what it needs to be changed in the DOM and apply the re-render A real application This a \"real\" example of the Hacker News implemented with Osagai as a PWA.

Define a Web component Osagai comes with a function called define that defines a new custom element that you can use in your application. define receives the name of the custom element (it must contain a hyphen) and the Osagai component. The Osagai component is a function that returns a Template with a string representing the layout of the web component. import { define } from 'osagai' function MyComponent() { return () = Hi üëã! } define('waving-hand', MyComponent) Now, you just need to use your new custom element in your application.
